# Web Benchmark

An environment suitable for building a web application with a connected database. This includes the `flask` web framework, the `gunicorn` WSGI server, `sqlalchemy` for database manipulation, `marshmellow` for schema validation, a bunch of plugins to these tools, a few `google` APIs for communicating with resources in GCP, and some common debugging, linting, and testing utilities like `flake8`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `hypothesis` etc.
