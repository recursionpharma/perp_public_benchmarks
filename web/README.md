An environment suitable for building a web application with a connected database. This includes the `flask` web framework, `sqlalchemy` for database manipulation, `marshmellow` for schema validation, a bunch of plugins to these tools, and some common debugging/linting utilities like `flake8`, `safety`, `mypy`, etc.
